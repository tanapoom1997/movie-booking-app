### use node version: 16.19.0

### docker compose up

### Wait until app can connect to database. it should be restart. and already use should be show log "Connection has been established successfully."

### connect database via DBeaver with host:120.0.0.1 port:3306 username:root password:password and try to connect it.

### create table with sql statement in mysql.txt

### prefer "npm i -g nodemon" for dev debug.

### before start app use command "npm i" for install package.

### start app on local with "nodemon start" 

### if start server can use postman_collection.json for import request to postman for testing

### Thank you.
